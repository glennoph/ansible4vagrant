* Motivation
- Ansible use is to deploy an application after a build.
- The build is executed first which can take 10-20 minutes
- Changes in the ansible code are slowed due to the build timing.
- Need a way to quickly run the ansible code in order to test changes.
* First Option: Run Ansible from Vagrant
** Installs
*** Install Ansible
*** Install Vagrant
*** Install Virtualbox
** Use
* H3
